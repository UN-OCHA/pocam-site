# OCHA theme

## Build

Normal building of assets can be triggered using `grunt`, while developing you can use `grunt watch`

After committing all changes to sass and js files, commit them separately.

Before committing the css, make sure to run `grunt critical` to update the css files that will be injected in the head of the pages.

> By default criticalcss is created against `http://aide.docksal`
